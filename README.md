It was a good challenge to assess the ability of a React dev. I'd have done more if I had more time. I have configured webpack from scratch instead of using CRA and finished all the bonus requirements listed in the challenge.

The API endpoints provided were pretty good to get the job done but I felt that there should be another endpoint to push all the existing tasks at once as the current setup doesn't allow re-ordering tasks in same priority section to persist on refresh.

I was able to persist the re-ordering via drag and drop when source and destination sections are different by making use of the update endpoint.

**npm install** will install all the deps. **firebase serve** will start the app in development mode locally and **npm run build** will spit out the production code.
